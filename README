Shared Memory Cacher

Key-value storage in shared memory.
Works faster than big key-value storages, as Memcache or Redis, but can use memory of 1 server only.

Features:
* Multiaccess - multiple readers, one writer
* Tags for keys
* Dog-pile and race-condition effects excluded

Class MultiAccess can be used separately too.

PHP version: 5.3 (replace __DIR__ to dirname(__FILE__) for 5.2)
PHP should support shm-functions and msg-functions (--enable-shmop --enable-sysvsem --enable-sysvshm --enable-sysvmsg)

Tested in working project since June 2010.

Look at cooments for info. Ask, what you want to see commented.
