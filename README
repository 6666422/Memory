As a storage can be used the shared memory or the APC extension.

For APCObject:
	APC (http://pecl.php.net/package/APC) should be installed, and some settings should be added in php.ini (or apc.ini if you use it)
	Required: apc.slam_defense = Off
	Optional:
	apc.ttl = 7200
	apc.user_ttl = 3600
	apc.shm_size = 64M

For SHMObject and MultiAccess:
