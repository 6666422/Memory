Shared Memory Cacher

Key-value storage in shared memory.
As a storage can be used the shared memory or the APC extension.

Features:
* Tags for keys
* Dog-pile and race-condition effects excluded
* Increment can work with arrays, strings and numeric values
* MultiAccess class can be used for any resource

Usage:
	For basic usage, download memory.inc and see demo.php to get documentation.
	As advantage, MultiAccess and classes from mem.inc can be used, if APC is not installed on your server.

Requirements:
PHP version: 5.3
For APCObject:
	APC (http://pecl.php.net/package/APC) should be installed, and this setting should be added in php.ini (or apc.ini if you use it)
	apc.slam_defense = Off

For SHMObject and MultiAccess:
	PHP should support shm-functions and msg-functions (--enable-shmop --enable-sysvsem --enable-sysvshm --enable-sysvmsg)
