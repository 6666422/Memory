Shared Memory Cacher

Key-value storage in shared memory.
As a storage can be used the shared memory or the APC extension.

Features:
* Tags for keys
* Dog-pile and race-condition effects excluded
* MultiAccess class can be used for any resource

PHP version: 5.3
For APCObject:
	APC (http://pecl.php.net/package/APC) should be installed, and some settings should be added in php.ini (or apc.ini if you use it)
	Required: apc.slam_defense = Off
	Optional:
	apc.ttl = 7200
	apc.user_ttl = 3600
	apc.shm_size = 64M

For MemoryAsObject, MultiAccess:
	PHP should support shm-functions and msg-functions (--enable-shmop --enable-sysvsem --enable-sysvshm --enable-sysvmsg)

APC is faster, but can have some fragmentation issues - check, if it works normal for you. This issues can be solved only by the APC developers.
